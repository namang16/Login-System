# Login System

This project is a simple demonstration of how a Login System works.
You can create a new user account or login into an existing account.
It has various constraints :-
- The username should be minimum 4 characters long and it cannot exceed 10 characters.
- Password should be minimum 8 characters long.
I have used the concept of file handling which i had learned in my last semester.
## Features

- Password hidden while entering
- white spaces, special characters other than '@' are not considered in Password
- Username and Password can be changed after login
